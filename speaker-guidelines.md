# Ember London Speaker Guidelines

- Your talk should be **15–30 minutes**
- Do not use a pure white background  
  (the projector gets confused)
- You will be using your own laptop  
  (let us know if you’d rather not)
- Feel free to live code  
  (we can capture it just fine)
- You will have somewhat restricted internet access  
  (HTTP(S), but no SSH)
- Avoid content which may make people uncomfortable  
  (if in doubt, please ask)
- If you intend to adapt the Tomster (Ember’s hamster mascot) please let us know as the adaptation will need approval

We’re very happy to help prepare and review your slides. If you’d like to rehearse, let us know and it can be arranged.
